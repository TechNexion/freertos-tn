Hardware requirements
=====================
- Micro USB cable
- IMX95LP4XEVK-15 board
- J-Link Debug Probe
- 12V~20V power supply
- MIPI DSI panel
- Personal Computer

Board settings
==============
For MIPI DSI panel(1080*2340), connect MINISAS DSI port J20 to panel.
For MIPI2HDMI card(1920*1080), connect MINISAS DSI port J20 to card.

Prepare the Demo
================
1.  Connect 12V power supply and J-Link Debug Probe to the board, switch SW5 to power on the board.
2.  Connect a micro USB cable between the host PC and the J31 USB port on the cpu board.
3.  Open a serial terminal with the following settings:
    - 115200 baud rate

5.  Launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the example.

Steps to configure the panels
===============
Default panel is MIPI DSI panel, default port is DPU_DI_MIPI, default setting for APP_DISPLAY_EXTERNAL_CONVERTOR is disabled
Tips: The APP_DISPLAY_EXTERNAL_CONVERTOR can be set as 1 when you are using MIPI2HDMI card(ADV7535) only.

When Kconfig is used
----------------
Below setting is for kconfig, you can fix below settings in dpu/warp/cm7/prj.conf
For default MIPI DSI panel, you do not need to change anything.
For MIPI2HDMI card(1920*1080):
CONFIG_APP_DISPLAY_EXTERNAL_CONVERTOR=y
CONFIG_MCUX_PRJSEG_module.board.display_support.MIPI2HDMI=y

When package is used
----------------
Below setting is for mcux_config.h.
Setting DEMO_PANEL to MIPI2HDMI to use MIPI2HDMI card(1920*1080), you need to set APP_DISPLAY_EXTERNAL_CONVERTOR to 1.
For default MIPI DSI panel, you do not need to change anything.
