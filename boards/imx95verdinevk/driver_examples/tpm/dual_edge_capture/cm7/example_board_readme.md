Hardware requirements
=====================
- Micro USB cable
- IMX95VERDIN-EVK board
- J-Link Debug Probe
- 12V~20V power supply
- Personal Computer

Board settings
==============
- Connect J57-1 and J29-7(GND) to Oscilloscope
- note: square wave at fixed rate is recommended as the input signal for easily checking the result. 

Prepare the Demo
===============
1.  Connect 12V~20V power supply and J-Link Debug Probe to the board, switch S6 to power on the board.
2.  Connect a micro USB cable between the host PC and the J4 USB port on the cpu board.
3.  Open a serial terminal with the following settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
4.  Download the program to the target board.
5.  Launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the example.

Running the demo
===============
When the example runs successfully, the following message is displayed in the terminal:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
TPM dual-edge capture example

Once the input signal is received the input capture values are printed

The input signal's pulse width is calculated from the capture values & printed

Capture value C(n)V=8c40

Capture value C(n+1)V=e104

Input signals pulse width=904 us
